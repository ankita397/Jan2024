1. Shortest path or Minimum steps 
    a. Rotting Oranges - Leetcode 994
    b. 01Matrix - Leetcode 542

    Tip : Call bfs at the end of the loop for Dynamic Processes where one cell affects/changes another

2. Connected Components and Reachability:
    a. NumberOfIslands - Leetcode 200

    Tip : Call bfs from inside loop for Static Connectivity in a Grid where the cells dont change

3. Cycle detection in undirected graph
    a. DetectCycleInUndirectedGraph_BFS

    Tip : Store the elements and their corresponding parents - For source element, parent = -1.
    Consider to call bfs for each connected graph. So we need to find starting element of each connected graph
