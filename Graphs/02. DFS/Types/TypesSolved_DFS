1. Graph connectivity (Different from Connected Components and Reachability) - Can be solved using BFS also (DFS is best)
    a. Number of Enclaves - Leetcode 1020

    Tip : Call bfs for non-visited 1's on all 4 boundaries. Count the remaining non-visited 1's as they won't not be connected to boundary.

2. Cycle detection in undirected graph - Can be solved using BFS also (DFS is best)
    a. DetectCycleInUndirectedGraph_DFS

    TTip : Consider elements and their corresponding parents - For source element, parent = -1.
    Consider to call dfs for each connected graph. So we need to find starting element of each connected graph.
    If adjacent node is visited and is not its own parent node - this means it was visited by someone else. So its a repeating node,         
    confirming a cycle.

4. Boundary vs. Non-Boundary Cells - Can be solved using BFS also (DFS is best)
    a. Number of Enclaves - Leetcode 1020 (can be solved using DFS also)
