 * In Binary Search Tree, Inorder Successor of an input node can is defined as the 
 * node with the smallest key greater than the key of the input node. 
 * Note: Inorder of a BST is always already sorted.
 * In Binary Tree, Inorder successor of a node is the next node in Inorder traversal of the Binary Tree. 
 * Inorder Successor is NULL for the last node in Inorder traversal. 
 *
 * TC = O(H) ~ O(logN)
 * SC = O(1)
